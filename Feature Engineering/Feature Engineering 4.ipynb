    "Covariance is a statistical measure that describes the relationship between two random variables. Specifically, it measures how much two variables vary together, meaning how much the values of one variable change when the values of the other variable change. A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to vary in opposite directions. A covariance of zero indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it provides a way to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. This relationship can be used to better understand the underlying data and can help in modeling and prediction. For example, in finance, the covariance between two stocks can be used to construct a diversified portfolio that minimizes risk. In machine learning, covariance is used in dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) to find the most important features or variables.\n",

    "Where Σ represents the sum, xi and yi are the individual observations of X and Y, μX and μY are the sample means of X and Y, and n is the sample size.\n",

Therefore, it is common to normalize the covariance by dividing it by the product of the standard deviations of X and Y.
