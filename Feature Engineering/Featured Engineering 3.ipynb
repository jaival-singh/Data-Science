    "\n",
    "Nominal encoding and one-hot encoding are actually the same thing, and the terms are often used interchangeably. One-hot encoding is a type of nominal encoding where each category value is assigned a binary value, and it is the most commonly used nominal encoding technique in data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another type of nominal encoding called label encoding, where each unique category value is assigned a numerical label. Label encoding can be useful in situations where the categorical values have an inherent order or ranking, such as rating scales or levels of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a dataset of job applicants, we might have a feature for the level of education, with values such as high school, bachelor's degree, and master's degree. We could use label encoding to assign numerical labels to each of these values, with high school as 1, bachelor's degree as 2, and master's degree as 3. This would allow us to preserve the inherent order of the values while still transforming them into numerical data for use in machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when the categorical variable exhibits a large number of unique categories, as it helps to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. This reduction can be crucial for computational efficiency and model interpretability, especially in scenarios with limited computational resources or when dealing with high-cardinality categorical variables. For instance, when analyzing text data with a large vocabulary, nominal encoding may be preferred over one-hot encoding to represent words efficiently, as one-hot encoding would create a sparse matrix with many columns."

    "\n",
    "The reason why we would choose one-hot encoding in this scenario is that nominal encoding techniques such as one-hot encoding are preferred for categorical data because they can accurately represent the categorical data in numerical form without creating false relationships between categories.

This technique represents each category as a binary vector, with only one bit set to 1 to denote the presence of a particular category, allowing for efficient processing by machine learning algorithms. Since the categorical variables such as species, habitat, and diet don't have an inherent ordinal relationship and each category is distinct, nominal encoding is ideal.
